# Welcome to my blog

The blog aims at building up concepts required to understand Rust. Each post builds up the concepts in an intuitive way. Each post is a result of extensive research and a lot of effort has been put into making sure all content is valid as of **Rust 1.90.0**

# A series on machine learning concepts is also in progress.

Stay tuned!
